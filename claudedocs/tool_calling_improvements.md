# Tool Calling Improvements - Fixing Agent Confusion

## Problem Identified
The AI agent was incorrectly choosing `search_agent_dataset` instead of calendar tools when users requested appointment/booking functionality. This happened because:

1. **Naming Confusion**: Both tools had "search" in their names
2. **Description Overlap**: The dataset tool mentioned "appointments" in its enum
3. **Missing Calendar Tools**: Calendar tools weren't included in the agent's function definitions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Tool Renaming and Clarity
- **Renamed** `search_agent_dataset` → `search_business_knowledge_base`
- **Added clear distinctions** in descriptions:
  - Knowledge base tool: "for static business information (NOT for appointments/bookings)"
  - Calendar tools: "for appointment booking, scheduling, or calendar management"

### 2. Updated Function Definitions
**Before:**
```python
{
    "name": "search_agent_dataset",
    "description": "Search business datasets (clients, hours, inventory, pricing, policies, etc.)",
    # Could be confused with appointment management
}
```

**After:**
```python
{
    "name": "search_business_knowledge_base",
    "description": """Search static business information stored in knowledge databases (NOT for appointments/bookings).
    IMPORTANT: This searches STATIC information only. For appointment booking, scheduling, or calendar management, use calendar tools instead."""
}
```

### 3. Added Calendar Tools to Agent
Added 3 essential calendar tools to `FUNCTION_DEFINITIONS`:

1. **`create_calendar_event`** - For booking new appointments
2. **`list_calendar_events`** - For checking availability and existing appointments
3. **`cancel_calendar_event`** - For canceling appointments

### 4. Backward Compatibility
- Maintained legacy alias in `FUNCTION_MAP` so existing integrations continue working
- Both `search_agent_dataset` and `search_business_knowledge_base` map to the same function

### 5. Auto-Context Injection
Updated Twilio endpoints to automatically inject required context:

- **Knowledge base tools**: Get `tenant_id` and `agent_id`
- **Calendar tools**: Get `agent_id` automatically
- No manual parameter passing required from the AI agent

## Expected Behavior Now

| User Request | Tool Agent Should Choose | Why |
|--------------|-------------------------|-----|
| "Book an appointment" | `create_calendar_event` | Clear appointment creation intent |
| "What's available tomorrow?" | `list_calendar_events` | Checking calendar availability |
| "Cancel my Tuesday appointment" | `cancel_calendar_event` | Appointment cancellation |
| "What are your hours?" | `search_business_knowledge_base` | Static business information |
| "How much for a haircut?" | `search_business_knowledge_base` | Static pricing information |
| "What services do you offer?" | `search_business_knowledge_base` | Static service catalog |

## Files Modified

1. **`app/config/agent_constants.py`**
   - Renamed main dataset search tool
   - Added 3 calendar tools to function definitions
   - Enhanced descriptions for clarity

2. **`app/config/agent_functions.py`**
   - Renamed function implementation
   - Added calendar tool wrappers
   - Maintained backward compatibility alias

3. **`app/api/twilio_endpoints.py`**
   - Updated context injection for both tool types
   - Added support for new tool names
   - Enhanced parameter handling

## Testing Verification

The changes ensure:
- ✅ Clear semantic separation between static info vs. dynamic appointments
- ✅ Automatic context injection (no manual parameter passing)
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing code
- ✅ Comprehensive calendar management capabilities
- ✅ Reduced likelihood of tool selection errors

## Zero-Shot Examples Alternative

If further clarity is needed, zero-shot examples could be added to tool descriptions:

```python
"examples": [
    {"user_input": "I want to book an appointment", "correct_tool": "create_calendar_event"},
    {"user_input": "What are your hours?", "correct_tool": "search_business_knowledge_base"}
]
```

However, the current naming and description improvements should be sufficient for proper tool selection.
